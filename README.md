## Project Theme

Name: **Louis Locator**

Author: Kaveh Alemi

Theme:

In the book "_Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel_" by George Orwell, there is a large emphasis on big government spying on it's citizens. One of the technologies this government uses is spy cameras that identify and track people. 

This technology is purely engineered by big government to track HUMANS. But, what happens when dogs/canines become revolutionary and want to overthrow the government? How will the government track dogs in order to keep them on a tight leash (pun intended). Well they no longer have to worry, because I've created a prototype for this exact use case. 

**Louis Locator** is a prototype identification system used to identify dogs from static images, batch image containers, and live feeds from security/spy cameras. Given that I only had 24 hours to engineer this system, I only made it a binary classifier, where it can identify if my own dog, named Louis, is seen in an image, a batch container of images, or a live feed.
